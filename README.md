# ExpressStarter 
Just an express starter I made to save peoples time


# How to start a node project (For those that dont know) 

```bash
npm init
```
Its gonna ask you questions make sure you fill out the name to what you like and author to you



```bash
npm install express
```
This installed express!


Now you have one last step!!

```bash
npm run start
```
STARTER = shorter starter.js
Again feel free to change starter.js to what you want but the actual js file must be called that
